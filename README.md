# Rodrigo Bondoc - #BlackLivesMatter #AllBlackLivesMatter

Hi there! I'm Rodrigo (he/him/his) -- a software developer specializing in Python and JavaScript to build things for the web. I'm an Electrical Engineer turned software developer after falling in love with web development. I enjoy using my knowledge of hardware and networks together with my software skills to understand and solve problems 🤓

I'm based in San Diego, CA 🌞🌊. I'm a big video game nerd/geek (PC, PS4), Pop/House/R&B music lover 🎶, and a wanderer ✈

## My Values
🌈 Inclusivity<br>
🌟 Authenticity in self<br>
🤗 Understanding of others<br>
🙏🏽 Kindness towards our fellow humans<br>

## My Current Projects
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/rbondoc96/lab-scraper">Lab Scraper</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/rbondoc96/Occupational-Health-Network">Occupational Health Network</a></li>
</ul>

## How I Work
I'm a problem solver 😎 My motivation is that when I'm given a problem, I want to find the most optimal solution possible on the back-end and make the user experience as simple as possible. I like to work on/be exposed to all aspects of a project (hardware, front-end, back-end) so I can fully understand how all the pieces work together to help me come up with a good solution.
